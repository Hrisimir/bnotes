Tech
-----------

BNotes uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Zend Framework] - Zend Framework is an open source framework for developing web applications and services using PHP. Zend Framework uses 100% object-oriented code and utilises most of the new features of PHP namely namespaces, late static binding, lambda functions and closures.
* [MySQL] - Open-source relational database management system (RDBMS)
* [JQuery] -  fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

Installation
--------------

```sh
The project requires MySQL 5+ and PHP 5.2+ Web server installed. (LAMP, or Zend Sever recommended)
SQL files to create databases with misc data can be found in docs folder in both of the projects.

Folders CRM and LOGIN should be copied to HTDOCS and virtual hosts created respectfully
